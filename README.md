# Responsive-Book-Landing-Page
I developed a fully responsive landing page for a book, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a clean and intuitive navigation bar with sections for HOME (current), COURSE, PRICE, PAGES, FACT, and ABOUT. The page is designed to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.
